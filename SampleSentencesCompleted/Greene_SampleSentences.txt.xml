<TEXT><![CDATA[There was also serious conflict in the South.

Armed conflict in the northern Saada region declined markedly after a February 11 ceasefire.

There were reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings during the year.

Members of the security forces continued to detain journalists for publishing articles the government deemed controversial

There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.

They last did so in free and fair elections on May 6.

The government limited press freedom, censoring and banning media outlets, which operated with restrictions.

The constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press "within the limits of the law"; however, the government did not respect these rights in practice.
 
Prison and detention center conditions generally met international standards, and the government permitted visits by independent human rights observers.

Prisoners and detainees had reasonable access to visitors and were permitted to observe and practice their respective religions.

The constitution prohibits such practices; however, there were reports that individual police officers occasionally used excessive force.

In the course of the year, security forces killed dozens of persons and injured hundreds of others in a series of increasingly violent demonstrations in Dhale, Lahj, Aden, Abyan, and Hadramout governorates.

During the year the government launched mass preemptive arrest campaigns across the southern governorates and used excessive force to disperse demonstrations that sometimes involved tens of thousands of protesters.
